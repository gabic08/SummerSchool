# SummerSchool
A Web site for a summer school

1) The organizers of a summer school want to create a site to promote it. It must include:
- A page with general information about the summer school (“Home”)
- A page showing the list of courses (“Courses”)
- A page that introduces course trainers (“Trainers”)
- A page presenting the organizers of summer school (“Organizers”)
- A page presenting the news (“News”)
- A page showing the calendar (“Calendar”)
- A contact page ("Contact")<br.
The site will need to be able to navigate between those pages.

2) The site must contain also:
 <br>a) News management (addition, modification, deletion);
<br>b) Management of the list of courses (addition, modification, deletion);
<br>c) Registration of participants and display of the list of registered participants.
<br>d) Protection of the administration section by user and password (username is "admin" and password is "parola").
